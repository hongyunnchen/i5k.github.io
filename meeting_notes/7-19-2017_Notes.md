**i5K Coordinating Group**

**Conference Call Agenda**

**July 19, 2017**

**10:00-11:00 (EDT**)

_The meeting will focus on positioning i5K to take advantage of potential funding opportunities resulting from the Earth BioGenome Project and other global or local genomics efforts._

Notes are added to the original agenda in _italics._

_Attending: Anna Childers, Chris Childers, Kevin Hackett, Monica Poelchau, Marian Goldsmith, Monica Munoz-Torres, Sue Brown_

- Nominations for Core Taxonomic Groups (fringy, Anna). _Immediate goal is to develop prioritized lists of species that cover all Arthropod families_
  - i5k Species Nomination Database Update (Anna)
  - Identify and Recruit Order or Family Taxal Leads to Nominate Additional Species
    - Create Master List (Anna)
    - _Anna – creating a table to help organize._

- Prioritization of Species (fringy)
  - Create Criteria for Prioritization (Moni)
    - _Moni: Haven&#39;t completed the criteria yet, but the people are connecting, and hopefully things will be put together in the next couple of week._
- Organization of Sequenced and Nominated Species by Phylogeny
  - Determine the Best Schematic, i.e., Method of Display/Access (Chris)
    - _Chris: No updates._

- Social Media Development Update (Moni, Marian)
  - _Moni: Not much progress, but – there are a number of us that have access to i5k twitter and facebook, and Anna has been active (re-tweeting papers, etc). We&#39;ve consolidated to  i5k account (at least only things will be posted on one account)- for twitter, this is &#39;arthropod i5k&#39;. Moni will give the accounts a facelift. Rob Waterhouse has been good about sending things along to our account, too. Will try to get more followers._
  - _Anna: how do you fish for more followers? Moni – just look for scientists that are related to your interests, then you follow them. More often than not, they will follow back._
- Expand Participation in Monthly i5K Coordinating Group Calls (Kevin)

- i5K-East Organization
  - Recruit Alexie to Lead (Monica)
    - _Monica – Alexie&#39;s recruited a group, but it appears to be a broader taxonomic scope that is diverging from i5k. Will follow up with Alexie_
- Team Lead to Finalize Invitee List and Write Letter of Invitation
  - _Kevin: team lead needs to be recruited. Talked last time that we won&#39;t invite everyone to a coordinating group; on the other hand, we could certainly triple the number of people attending and still be fine._
  - _Anna: can be on the recruitment team (connections via webinar), but can&#39;t promise to lead it._
  - _There was general discussion on how to motivate new people to 1) join the coordinating committee and 2) affiliate their project with i5k._

- Funding (Kevin): _Discussion postponed until September_

- Other Business

- Publication, USDA Ag Research, Picture of i5K Pilot Arthropods (Kevin, fringy)
- i5K Webinar Update (Anna, Chris)
  - _If people have suggestions about webinar topics, please email Anna!_

- i5K Workspace Webinar (Chris)
  - _Chris – turnout was pretty good (~30 people)_
- Cornome (Jay)
  - _Kevin: moving along, some Illumina, some PacBio, some nanopore._

Other:

- _Anna: Dovetail has a contest right now if anyone wants to enter…_
- _Kevin: Kevin will give a short talk on EBP/i5k at ESA this fall._

**NEXT MEETING: September 20, 2017**
