### To get news about the webinar series and other i5k activities, please subscribe to the low volume Arthropod News [mailing list](https://listserv.ksu.edu/?SUBED1=ARTHROPODNEWS&A=1)<br><br>

<a name="details"></a> 
Worried about error rates, validation issues, sample sizes or other details of genomic sequencing, assembly and analysis?  Bring your questions and help us have a lively discussion with our speakers.

__Who:__  Webinars are open to all researchers interested in arthropod genomics.

__What:__  Presentations by representatives from genomic technology companies, databases and research groups.  Webinars will be 1 hour long, but presentations will be kept short enough to allow plenty of time for participants to ask questions.

__When:__  First Wednesday of each month at 11am EDT<br>*Please click the date in the schedule below to check your timezone.  Due to differences between countries in the date of daylight savings time changes, event times may vary.*

__Why:__  Some of the impacts made by i5k are through training and education to promote the adoption of best practices for methodologies, informatics and standards.  Our goal for the webinar series is to provide outreach and education by introducing researchers to a variety of techniques, technologies and best practices to help move their research forward.

__How:__  The webinars will use the AT&T Connect software
<br>*We will have 250 connection lines available so please consider gathering in groups where possible to access the webinar.*

| __Connection Type__ | __Details__ |
| ---- | ---- |

You may join your audio through your computer or if your computer does not support an audio connection, you may connect the audio portion of the webinar via a telephone (see Audio Connection type for details).<br><br>1. [Connect to the Web Conference using the AT&T Connect application](https://connect16.uc.att.com/usda/meet/?ExEventID=86042415)<br>Link will provide a prompt to download the application and will launch the application once installed.<br><br>2. [Connect through your WEB BROWSER without downloading the AT&T Connect application](https://www.connectmeeting.att.com)<br>Meeting Number:  8888449904 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meeting Code: 5909637 |
|Audio Connection via Telephone|1. USA Access:  USA Toll-Free: 888-844-9904, then enter Code: 5909637# or USA Caller Paid: 816-423-4261, then enter Code: 5909637# <br><br>2. [International Access Numbers](https://www.teleconference.att.com/servlet/glbAccess?process=1&accessNumber=8888449904&accessCode=5909637)<br> A number in your country or in a country close to you (may not be toll free).<br><br>3. When prompted, enter the Meeting Access Code: 5909637# <br><br>4. Link the computer session with the telephone session:  After you have both the computer and telephone sessions established, click on the top menu tab "Audio/Video."  Select the second option "Telephone Connection Instructions."  Look for the section "Already Connected by Phone."  Locate the "Link" number and type the link number directly into the keypad of the telephone as #-sign, the six digit number, and follow with the #-sign.  Close the dialog box.<br>*It is important to link your computer and telephone sessions so only one connection line is used per participant.*|

|October&nbsp;5,&nbsp;2016 |<br>__Speaker:__ Jonas Korlach, Chief Scientific Officer, and Sarah Kingan, Senior Scientist Bioinformatics, Pacific Biosciences<br><br>__Title:__ High-Quality De Novo Insect Genome Assemblies using PacBio Sequencing<br><br>__Summary:__ PacBio Sequencing is characterized by very long sequence reads (average >10,000 bases), lack of GC-bias, and high consensus accuracy. These features have allowed the method to provide a new gold standard in de novo genome assemblies, producing highly contiguous (contig N50 > 1 Mb) and accurate (> QV 50) genome assemblies. We will briefly describe the technology and then highlight the full workflow, from sample preparation through sequencing to data analysis, on examples of insect genome assemblies, and illustrate the difference these high-quality genomes represent with regard to biological insights, compared to fragmented draft assemblies generated by short-read sequencing.<br><br>__[Slides](webinar_slides/i5K_webinar_PacBio_Oct5_2016.pdf)__<br>__[Video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMAc4gGIlQ)__<br><br>|

I will present general principles of genome assembly and analysis ranging from (inbred) colonies to more recent work on field-sourced individuals.  Based on these multiple consortium efforts, I will provide information on how to take full advantage of informatics resources available, including but not limited to VectorBase and overcoming potential road-blocks finding or submitting non-model genome data.  Finally, I will share emerging results efforts, including my own, to improve genome assemblies of important mosquito vectors using data discussed in other i5K webinars in this series.<br><br>__[Slides](webinar_slides/i5k_webinar_VectorBase_01_04_2017.pdf)__<br>__Video recording coming soon__<br><br>|
