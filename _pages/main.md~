title: "i5k:  Sequencing Five Thousand Arthropod Genomes"
type: single

The i5k initiative is a transformative project that aims to organize the sequencing and analysis of the genomes of 5,000 arthropod species. Our initiative is broad and inclusive.

Our goals are to: 

* organize the sequencing and analysis of the genomes of 5,000 arthropod species;
* provide guidelines and best practices for arthropod genome projects and their data management;
* help exisiting and new arthropod genome projects find the most appropriate repository for their needs;
* grow a community around arthropod genomes that works towards improved sequencing, assembly, annotation, and data management standards

We provide guidelines for genome projects, hold webinars, and keep an up-to-date list of sequenced arthropod genomes. Sign up for our low-volume mailing list for our latest information.
