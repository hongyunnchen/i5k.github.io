**<span style="color:blue">So who is this i5k community?  If you work with arthropods and use genomics then you are a member!</span>**

The i5k initiative has a broad and inclusive mandate.  We provide guidelines for genome projects, hold webinars, and maintain an up-to-date list of sequenced arthropod genomes. 

Our goals are to:

* organize the sequencing and analysis of the genomes of 5,000 arthropod species;
* provide guidelines and best practices for arthropod genome projects and their data management;
* help exisiting and new arthropod genome projects find the most appropriate repository for their needs;
* grow a community around arthropod genomes that works towards improved sequencing, assembly, annotation, and data management standards

We encourage both collaborative and individual initiatives, avoiding at all cost the displacement of well-thought plans from individuals and institutions. In this spirit, i5K joined forces with [1KITE](http://1kite.org), the 1000 Insect Transcriptome Evolution project, which aims to study the transcriptomes of 1,000 insect species encompassing all recognized insect orders.

### Pilot Project
i5k performed a pilot project to sequence 28 species with the support of the [Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center](https://www.hgsc.bcm.edu/arthropods/i5k). These species were selected by one of 7 Working Groups from [787 community nominations](legacy_i5k_nominations) made at the original i5k website.

### Participate!
These are big goals and we won't be able to do it without you!  The active participation of the international research community is essential for the initiativeâ€™s success. Please engage with the community by signing up for our low E-mail volume [Arthropod News mailing list](https://listserv.ksu.edu/?SUBED1=ARTHROPODNEWS&A=1), nominating a species, and by attending the annual Arthropod Genomics Symposium held in June ([previous symposia](http://globalhealth.nd.edu/10th-annual-arthropod-genomics-symposium/previous-symposia/)). 

We also seek information about species for which sequencing is underway or for which you are actively seeking funding. This would avoid duplication of efforts, help us maintain a reliable database of progress, and facilitate future initiatives for post-sequencing informatics and community curation.
