The i5k initiative has a broad and inclusive mandate.  We provide guidelines for genome projects, hold webinars, and maintain an up-to-date list of sequenced arthropod genomes. 

Our goals are to:

* organize the sequencing and analysis of the genomes of 5,000 arthropod species;
* provide guidelines and best practices for arthropod genome projects and their data management;
* help exisiting and new arthropod genome projects find the most appropriate repository for their needs;
* grow a community around arthropod genomes that works towards improved sequencing, assembly, annotation, and data management standards

For more information, you can read [papers on the i5k initiative](/publications), view [publications resulting from the i5k initiative](/publications), or [get in touch](/contact).

These are big goals and we won't be able to do it without you!  Please engage with the community by signing up for our low Email volume [Arthropod News mailing list](https://listserv.ksu.edu/?SUBED1=ARTHROPODNEWS&A=1) and by attending the annual Arthropod Genomics Symposium held in June ([previous symposia](http://globalhealth.nd.edu/10th-annual-arthropod-genomics-symposium/previous-symposia/)).
