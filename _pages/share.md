Have data to share from your genome project, or need to find a database home for it? We recommend the following options:

- Hymenoptera: [Hymenoptera Genome Database](http://hymenopteragenome.org/)
- Ants: [Fourmidable](http://www.antgenomes.org/)
- Vectors: [VectorBase](https://www.vectorbase.org/)
- Aphids: [AphidBase](http://www.aphidbase.com/)
- Everything else: [i5k Workspace@NAL](https://i5k.nal.usda.gov/)
- [Ensembl](http://metazoa.ensembl.org/index.html) may also be willing to host your project, if you ask nicely.

Of course, please submit all of your primary data and genome assemblies to the appropriate [INSDC](http://www.insdc.org/) resource (e.g. [SRA](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) for raw reads, [GenBank](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) for genome assemblies).

Stay tuned for a more comprehensive guide on genome data management. 

Have a genome database for arthropods that's accepting new genomes and that you'd like to see listed here? [Contact us](_pages/contact), and we'll add it!

<!---
Future update: Add previous DBs (includes those that are specific to only one species) to new page here and link to it (http://arthropodgenomes.org/wiki/Resources)
