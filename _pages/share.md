Arthropod research communities interested in finding a home for their genome project may try the following resources:

- Hymenoptera: [Hymenoptera Genome Database](http://hymenopteragenome.org/)
- Hymenoptera - ant specific: [Fourmidable](http://www.antgenomes.org/)
- Insect vectors of disease: [VectorBase](https://www.vectorbase.org/)
- Aphids: [AphidBase](http://www.aphidbase.com/)
- Lepidoptera: [LepBase](http://lepbase.org/)
- Any arthropod: [i5k Workspace@NAL](https://i5k.nal.usda.gov/)
- Alternatively, you may contact [Ensembl Genomes](http://metazoa.ensembl.org/index.html) with your hosting requests.

All primary data and genome assemblies should be deposited in publicly available [INSDC](http://www.insdc.org/) resources (e.g. [SRA](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) for raw reads, [GenBank](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) for genome assemblies).

If you would like to add your database to this list, please [contact us](/_pages/contact).

<!---
Future update: Add previous DBs (includes those that are specific to only one species) to new page here and link to it (http://arthropodgenomes.org/wiki/Resources)
