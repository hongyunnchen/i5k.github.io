The 5,000 arthropod genomes initiative (i5k) is a transformative project that aims to organize the sequencing and analysis of 5,000 arthropod species. 

>*"This project is aimed at sequencing and analyzing the genomes of all species known to be important to worldwide agriculture and food safety, medicine, and energy production; all species used as models in biology; the most abundant insects in world ecosystems; and, to achieve a deep understanding of arthropod evolution, representatives of insect relatives in every major branch of arthropod phylogeny. The i5k initiative will be broad and inclusive, seeking to involve scientists from around the world and obtain funding from academia, governments, industry, and private sources. We also aim to encourage new collaborative research by computer scientists, bioinformaticians, and biologists to overcome the challenges of handling this unprecedented volume of data and derive meaning from these genomes."* [(Science, 2011)](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6023/1386)
