<tr><td>Antipaluria urichi</td><td>Janice Edgerly-Rooks</td><td>Nominated<br>(08/08/2011)</td><td></td><td>Medicine&#44; Systematics</td><td>This is a silk-spinning insect that has attracted more attention in recent years because of the unique aspects of its silk as well as their unusual behavior. Embiopterans are in a small&#44; unique order; they are an ancient lineage and therefore&#44; understanding their genome will help unravel phylogeny of the orthopteroidea&#44; which has been difficult to interpret. I propose that leaving them out of the project will leave a hole in the understanding of insect evolution. A number of labs are now studying embiopterans focusing on communication&#44; phylogeny&#44; silk evolution--its mechanics and molecular structure&#44; silk gland micro-morphology&#44; to name a few projects. Recent papers have revealed sequences for silks from a variety of embiopteran species&#44; and for a sample of genes important for phylogenetic work&#44; but much remains to be done on this order. The species proposed herein is Antipaluria urichi&#44; which is easy to rear. Lab cultures are available currently at Santa Clara University. Silk is probably the most important of their features in the context of the genome project; silk is becoming more of interest in general because of the potential products in medicine and bioengineering applications. Silk is inert and does not promote immune responses in humans&#44; and its application for skin grafts and other health materials has been recognized for years. Embiopterans produce the finest silks known&#44; and a number of different labs have begun work on biomechanical properties as well as nano-technology. The very small diameters of embiid silks lend qualities of interest to chemical-physicists and to molecular biologists working with silk. These labs include Arizona State University&#44; CSIRO Australia&#44; and UC Riverside. Gland morphology has also recently been studied by a graduate student in Germany as well. Very few people have ever studied this small order and therefore I cannot claim that many scientists currently work on them. I do claim&#44; however&#44; that knowledge of their genomes would add to our understanding of insect evolution&#44; beyond searching for information related to silk properties and mechanics&#44; which has great potential value for science and technology and for health applications.</td></tr>

There is currently one aphid genome and plans to sequence more aphid genomes&#44; a whitefly genome and a psyllid genome&#44; but no scale insects have been proposed. A P. citri genome would facilitate comparative studies of the evolution of host genome architecture and metabolic pathways in the context of intracellular symbiosis&#44; regulation of symbiosis in general&#44; as well as studies on the origin and regulation of a novel organization for symbiotic bacteria in an insect. P. citri is an excellent candidate for sequencing because it is a crop pest and the symbiotic organization was originally described in P. citri&#44; in the strain I have in laboratory culture. I am in the process of generating an inbred line from an isofemale parent strain I have made in the lab. The inbred line can serve as the template for genome sequencing.

Procambarus clarkii have been used for decades as a model for studying synaptic plasticity&#44; circuits&#44; behaviour&#44; and so forth; thus&#44; these animals are an integral organism. Additionally&#44; these animals have ecological significance&#44; as some P clarkii are considered invasive species outside of Southwestern US. However&#44; lack of sequence information for this species has inhibited research groups from progressing their studies. With the sequence known&#44; researchers will be able to utilize widely used analytic techniques (Western blot&#44; PCR&#44; etc) to further their understanding of mechanisms involved with the various studied phenomenon in this preparation. For example&#44; cellular and molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity are still not fully understood. With the sequence known&#44; specific proteins and molecular players involved in plasticity can be elucidated. These can then be compared to other model organisms&#44; such as Drosophilia and Mus musculus&#44; to verify evolutionary similarities/differences. Molecular biology techniques&#44; partnered with electrophysiology and histochemistry&#44; will provide significant information with respect to short term synaptic plasticity. Although the number of current labs experimenting with crayfish is seemingly small&#44; this is largely a result of lack of sequence information being available. An important use of crayfish not revealed in the survey above is that this animal is used extensive in undergraduate education. Its relatively large size makes it easy to manipulate. It is cheap.

C7 has been highly amenable to both field and laboratory research in population ecology1&#44; reproductive biology2&#44;3&#44;4&#44; aposematism5 &#44; and chemical ecology6&#44;7. C7 is a successfully introduced biological control agent for management of agricultural pests including aphids&#44; white flies&#44; and scale insects8 &#44; but it has become invasive and is displacing native species in parts of its range1. As a member of Coleoptera&#44; which contains more species than any other order of animals (about 25% of all life forms)&#44; C7 would add to our understanding of phylogenetic relationships especially among insects and beetles. Currently only a single species of Coleoptera (Tribolium castaneum) has been fully sequenced9. Feasibility Genome size of C7 is 322 MB10. Many samples are readily available&#44; and an inbreed strain is under development at University of Kentucky. Genomic resources include 65&#44;000 SNPs identified by Restriction Associated DNA11. O&#39;Neill has experience with bioinformatics tools and is prepared to conduct genome assembly and annotation. Impact C7 plays an important role in the ecosystem as a top predator of the aphidophagus guild12. Currently&#44; this species is widely distributed across many different ecosystems and communities in both native and introduced ranges13. Genomic data will be crucial to study how major environmental factors associated with this wide distribution&#44; (e.g.&#44; temperature) affect selection&#44; and potentially drive large-scale patterns of adaptation. The introduction history is one of the best characterized of any invasive species14&#44;15&#44; making C7 a potential model system for elucidating the relationships between propagule pressure&#44; genomic diversity&#44; and natural selection in successful introductions. Understanding these relationships is important for both basic research on invasive species&#44; including interactions with native species that are being displaced and for the management of biological control agents in general1&#44;4. For these reasons&#44; obtaining a full genome from C7 would likely yield many benefits to both basic research on invasive species and applied research for biological control. C7 is an extremely tractable laboratory organism with an active research community.

<tr><td>Magicicada septendecim</td><td>Chris Simon</td><td>Nominated<br>(07/27/2011)</td><td>6500</td><td>Agriculture&#44; Ecosystem Function&#44; Model Organism&#44; Systematics</td><td>Model Organism: A rich Magicicada literature exists with more than 1000 papers referring to the genus (http://tmcnary.com/CicadaBibliography.htm). Periodical cicada research addresses diverse subjects including speciation&#44; sexual selection&#44; life history evolution&#44; acoustics&#44; predator/prey/symbiont/parasite interactions&#44; nutrient cycling&#44; bioaccumulation of heavy metals&#44; water/ion regulation&#44; thermoregulation&#44; ecological patchiness&#44; ecological determinants of animal distributions&#44; response of trees to damage&#44; etc. The unusual life cycles of periodical cicadas cry out for additional molecular study. The genetic basis of their extraordinary molecular clock is completely unknown. Even stranger is the fact that these cicadas are known to switch between 13 and 17-year lifecycles via 4-year jumps. This has happened at least three times in the last million years resulting in allochronic speciation. Agricultural Importance: Periodical cicadas have the longest life cycle from egg to adult of any insect and appear synchronously and periodically. They are probably the most unusual agricultural pest in that in any given orchard&#44; adults appear only once every 13- or 17-years; however nearly every year periodical cicadas appear somewhere in the eastern US. Although infrequent in any one location&#44; the effects are devastating. Female oviposition scars cause fruit laden branches to break. Millions of periodical cicada nymphs underground cause orchard decline. In forest ecosystems&#44; periodical cicadas are major players in nutrient cycling and their periodic emergences provide a rich food source for above-ground predators. Comparative Genomics: The infraordinal classification of Hemiptera (plant sucking bugs plus true bugs) remains in dispute. Several labs are collecting transcriptomic data for these insects and relatives (lice&#44; plant lice&#44; thrips&#44; etc.) The majority of data comes from sternorrhynchan Hemiptera (aphids&#44; scale insects&#44; and relatives) and from Heteroptera (true bugs). Many fewer members of the clade Auchenorrhyncha have been targeted and all of these are leafhoppers (Membracoidea). The groups Cicadoidea (cicadas)&#44; Cercopoidea (spittlebugs)&#44; and Fulgoroidea (plant hoppers) have not been selected. Sequencing at least one member of each of these key hemipteran groups would be important for comparative purposes. Genome Size: From the little information we have to date to date&#44; hemipteran genome sizes appear typical of hemimetabolous insects (> 2000 Mb). The exceptions are aphids (400-800 Mb) and the body louse (105 Mb). Periodical cicadas have quite large genomes 6400-6600 Mb (Johnston & Hanrahan&#44; unpubl.). Ironically&#44; cicada obligate endosymbionts have the smallest genomes known (144kb)! Spittlebugs are the sister group of cicadas and also have exceptionally large genomes. Could this have something to do with the fact that both groups feed on xylem fluid and are heavily dependent on endosymbionts for essential amino acids? It would be interesting to compare the genome size increase in these hemiptera to the similar phenomenon in Orthopteran insect orders. Proposal: We suggest sequencing a 17-year cicada (Magicicada septendecim) because this life cycle is hypothesized to be the ancestral condition but if there is space&#44; it would be really fascinating to sequence both a 13-year (Magicicada tredecim) and a 17-year cicada (Magicicada septendecim). We have plenty of fresh frozen tissue; these insects are large and we can easily get more than 10 ug of DNA from a single thorax (so as to rule out endosymbiont DNA or sperm in fertilized females). Alternatively&#44; males could be sequenced and endosymbiont genomes parsed out.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Bemisia tabaci</td><td>Judith K. Brown</td><td>Nominated<br>(03/18/2011)</td><td>1200</td><td>Agriculture&#44; Systematics</td><td>The whitefly sibling species group Bemisia tabaci (Genn.) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) is the most important whitefly pest worldwide&#44; causing millions of dollars in damage by reducing crop (floricultural&#44; horticultural&#44; fiber) yields each year worldwide. It colonizes a large number of non-agricultural eudicot species&#44; and is the sole insect vector for the largest known group of ssDNA plant viruses (genus Begomovirus) that infect endemic as well as cultivated plants. The group is so named because it is considered&#44; but not demonstrated genetically or in any other satisfactory way to comprise a group of variously related strains (races&#44; biotypes) and perhaps even closely related species. Members of the group are indistinguishable morphologically&#44; making them difficult to control at the level of selective &#39;exclusion&#39; (economic&#44; regulatory)&#44; and also making them a fundamentally interesting group from an evolutionary standpoint since they can only presently be distinguished on the basis of a suite of phenotypes and an informative molecular marker. Phenotypic variation is manifest in differences in invasiveness&#44; fecundity&#44; host preference/range&#44; long or short distance flight behavior&#44; extent of reproductive isolation&#44; suite of endosymbionts (some whose HSP aids in whitefly-mediated virus transmission)&#44; insecticide resistance&#44; vector competency&#44; and in ability to cause phytotoxic disorders caused solely by feeding. They are loosely &#39;identified&#39; and categorized phylogeographically based on the mt-COI gene&#44; the most informative of several molecular markers studied so far. Examination of microsatellites (STRs) and other population-informative loci (RAPDs&#44; AFLPs) show concrete evidence of high genetic differentiation and complex population structure among and within clades. Tight phylogeographical distribution&#44; high genetic differentiation&#44; together with structure within populations are consistent with the ability of B. tabaci to adapt to a broad range of ecological environments spanning tropical&#44; subtropical&#44; and mild temperate climes around the globe. Whether phenotypic plasticity is driven by genome-level differentiation (mutation and corresponding evolutionary changes in protein coding)&#44; or at the physiological level e.g. modulation of gene expression&#44; and/or epigenetic regulation is not known&#44; but could be informed by sequencing and analysis of multiple exemplar genomes of this widely studied sibling species group. Furthermore&#44; how associated endosymbionts (horizontally and vertically transmitted) contribute to plasticity or to adaptations that may require cooperative gene product interactions between the unrelated prokaryotic genomes and/or the eukaryotic (insect) genome&#44; are entirely unstudied. Consequently&#44; the B. tabaci sibling species group provides an exquisite model for elucidating gene networks and functional mechanisms that drive the phenotypic plasticity in this ancient whitefly group&#44; at times leading to biotype formation&#44; and likely also to recent speciation&#44; in some instances. This new knowledge will open uncharted avenues toward understanding the genomic features that influence the evolutionary and population biology of insect sibling species&#44; endosymbiont-host evolution&#44; and virus-vector interactions. Knowledge gained will readily have application to understanding the genomics contributions to biology and evolution in other sibling species groups and complexes&#44; both within and outside of the Hemiptera. The proposed effort would best be undertaken as a comparative one&#44; involving sequencing multiple genomes (up to 10) of genetically and behaviorally divergent B. tabaci haplotypes worldwide. Note: I am willing to coordinate procurements of a diverse suite of B. tabaci biotypes and haplotypes representative of this sibling species group from different continents and (agro+) ecosystems.</td></tr>

It occurs naturally in North and South America&#44; it has established in Australia and on islands in the Pacific. Several other Trichogramma species are also used in biological control and these are closely related to T. pretiosum. T. pretiosum has a short lifecyle of 11 days at 25 degrees Celcius and can be maintained on the eggs of the grainmoth Ephesia kuehniella. Eggs of this moth species can be acquired through commercial suppliers. Because of their small size many different cultures can be maintained in a small space&#44; we maintain our Trichogramma cultures in glass vials of 10cm*1.5cm. In addition to its importance in biological control of lepidopteran pests&#44; it is also very interesting because some populations are completely asexual because of an infection with Parthenogenesis Inducing Wolbachia. The age of these completely infected populations varies and their prolonged asexual reproduction has led to a decay in traits involved in sexual reproduction. For instance in the asexual populations from Peru females have lost the ability to fertilize their eggs&#44; while males- when produced by antibiotic treatment- still are sexually functional. In some Hawaiian populations of this species- males when they are produced by antibiotic treatment &#45; appear to be completely sterile. Having a genome of a sexual form of this species sequenced will allow us to determine the genes that are affected when a population becomes completely asexual&#44; by later comparing the genome of asexual forms to that of the sexual form. Many labs mailntain populations of Trichogramma pretiosum&#44; in our lab we maintain a large number of highly inbred lines that originate from California and have been inbred by sibmating for 9 generations.

<tr><td>Magicicada cassini</td><td>Chris Simon</td><td><br>(08/05/2011)</td><td>6700</td><td>Agriculture&#44; Ecosystem Function&#44; Energy&#44; Model Organism&#44; Systematics</td><td>Model Organism: A rich Magicicada literature exists with more than 1000 papers referring to the genus (http://tmcnary.com/CicadaBibliography.htm). Periodical cicada research addresses diverse subjects including speciation&#44; sexual selection&#44; life history evolution&#44; acoustics&#44; predator/prey/symbiont/parasite interactions&#44; nutrient cycling&#44; bioaccumulation of heavy metals&#44; water/ion regulation&#44; thermoregulation&#44; ecological patchiness&#44; ecological determinants of animal distributions&#44; response of trees to damage&#44; etc. The unusual life cycles of periodical cicadas cry out for additional molecular study. The genetic basis of their extraordinary molecular clock is completely unknown. Even stranger is the fact that these cicadas are known to switch between 13 and 17-year lifecycles via 4-year jumps. This has happened at least three times in the last million years resulting in allochronic speciation. Agricultural Importance: Periodical cicadas have the longest life cycle from egg to adult of any insect and appear synchronously and periodically. They are probably the most unusual agricultural pest in that in any given orchard&#44; adults appear only once every 13- or 17-years; however nearly every year periodical cicadas appear somewhere in the eastern US. Although infrequent in any one location&#44; the effects are devastating. Female oviposition scars cause fruit laden branches to break. Millions of periodical cicada nymphs underground cause orchard decline. In forest ecosystems&#44; periodical cicadas are major players in nutrient cycling and their periodic emergences provide a rich food source for above-ground predators. Comparative Genomics: The infraordinal classification of Hemiptera (plant sucking bugs plus true bugs) remains in dispute. Several labs are collecting transcriptomic data for these insects and relatives (lice&#44; plant lice&#44; thrips&#44; etc.) The majority of data comes from sternorrhynchan Hemiptera (aphids&#44; scale insects&#44; and relatives) and from Heteroptera (true bugs). Many fewer members of the clade Auchenorrhyncha have been targeted and all of these are leafhoppers (Membracoidea). The groups Cicadoidea (cicadas)&#44; Cercopoidea (spittlebugs)&#44; and Fulgoroidea (plant hoppers) have not been selected. Sequencing at least one member of each of these key hemipteran groups would be important for comparative purposes. The genomes of the two endosymbiont species obligate to Magicicada are being sequenced by John McCutcheon and he has volunteered to annotate the Magicicada genes involved in endosymbiont interactions. Genome Size: From the little information we have to date to date&#44; hemipteran genome sizes appear typical of hemimetabolous insects (> 2000 Mb). The exceptions are aphids (400-800 Mb) and the body louse (105 Mb). Periodical cicadas have quite large genomes 6400-6600 Mb (Johnston & Hanrahan&#44; unpubl.). Ironically&#44; cicada obligate endosymbionts have the smallest genomes known (144kb)! Spittlebugs are the sister group of cicadas and also have exceptionally large genomes. Could this have something to do with the fact that both groups feed on xylem fluid and are heavily dependent on endosymbionts for essential amino acids? It would be interesting to compare the genome size increase in these hemiptera to the similar phenomenon in Orthopteran insect orders. Proposal: We suggest sequencing a trio of periodical cicada species for comparative purposes. The first two have already been suggested: Magicicada septendecim (Linnaeus&#39; 17-year cicada) and Magicicada tredecim (Riley&#39;s 13-year cicada). We now suggest the third member of the trio&#44; Fisher&#39;s 17-year cicada (Magicicada cassini). Judging from mtDNA&#44; this species is approximately 7-8% (uncorrected p-distance) from the &#45;decim species (diverged ca. 3-4 Mya). These could be compared to a trio of Drosophila species with similar degrees of divergence. Magicicada cassini (like its sibling species M. tredecassini) is slightly smaller than its congeners M. septendecim and M. tredecim. M. cassini is often found sympatrically with other species that share its lifecycle and year of emergence. In the Midwestern US&#44; it is the most common periodical cicada and in Oklahoma and Texas&#44; it is the only species of periodical cicada. Ecologically&#44; it is most abundant in river valleys and other wet lowland forests. A comparison of the three species could reveal interesting aspects of the evolution of periodicity. For example&#44; we hypothesize that the two M. -cassini species originated allopatrically from the M. -decim species and later joined pre-existing year-classes of the M. &#45;decim species. We have plenty of fresh frozen tissue; these insects are large (only slightly smaller than the larger &#45;decim species) and we can easily get more than 10 ug of DNA from a single thorax (so as to rule out endosymbiont DNA or sperm in fertilized females). Alternatively&#44; males could be sequenced and endosymbiont genomes parsed out. 17-year cicadas will be out every May and June for the next 10 years in a row in the Eastern US.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Triatoma dimidiata</td><td>Eric Dumonteil&#44; Francisco Panzera</td><td>Nominated<br>(05/23/2011)</td><td>1000</td><td>Medicine&#44; Systematics</td><td>Triatoma dimidiata is a blood-sucking insect whose range extends from northern South America (Colombia&#44; Venezuela&#44; Ecuador&#44; and Peru)&#44; throughout all the countries of Central America and into Southern Mexico. It is among the most important carriers of Trypanosoma cruzi&#44; the flagellate protozoa that causes Chagas disease. T. cruzi parasite transmission occurs through insect feces&#44; which is a unique mechanism in insect vectors. However&#44; little is known about T. dimidiata biology&#44; or the relationships with T. cruzi parasites&#44; and a genome sequence would open the way to extensive studies on vector-parasite interactions at the molecular level. It is also ongoing speciation&#44; with several sub-species identified. Thus&#44; while triatomine genetics research has lagged somewhat compared to other insect species&#44; Triatomine species represent unique models for key biological processes. It is also ongoing speciation&#44; with several sub-species identified. Finally&#44; it is very difficult to control&#44; and thus of key medical importance&#44; and a genome sequence would be extremely useful to explore novel control strategies. Laboratory colonies and field specimen are widely available for the preparation of genetic material in several labs&#44; including ours. Chagas disease&#44; caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi&#44; is transmitted mainly by hematophagous insects of the subfamily Triatominae (Hemiptera: Reduviidae). Triatoma dimidiata Latreille is one of the main vectors of the disease&#44; with an extensive distribution from Northern Mexico through most of Central America to Colombia and Ecuador. Control programs are focused on eliminating bugs from human dwellings. However&#44; the control of T. dimidiata poses a particular challenge because of its ability to reinfest domestic and peridomestic habitats from sylvatic reservoirs. Genetic material is available in large quantities as there are several U.S. laboratories where they maintain breeding T. dimidiata (CDC Atlanta).</td></tr>

<tr><td>Trachymyrmex septentrionalis</td><td>Jon Seal</td><td>Nominated<br>(04/16/2011)</td><td>320</td><td>Ecosystem Function&#44; Systematics</td><td>1. Genomics of a species occupying an important evolutionary transition. Trachymyrmex septentrionalis belongs to a monophyletic group of fungus gardening ants&#44; which form the sister group to the ecologically and economically important leaf-cutting ants (Atta and Acromyrmex). This species is among the easiest species of Trachymyrmex to study since it is highly abundant and easy to maintain in the laboratory (1-6). The genomes of three leaf-cutting ants have been sequenced or are planned. No species of Trachymyrmex have been sequenced or are currently planned. Understanding the genomics of this species would provide the link between basal and derived forms of fungus-gardening&#44; but also illustrate evolutionary transitions in sociobiology and insect-fungal symbioses. For example&#44; Trachymyrmex exhibits weak polymorphism and intermediate colony and queen sizes&#44; which is transitional from basal species which have strictly monomorphic castes&#44; small colonies and queens to Atta colonies which have highly polymorphic castes and among the largest ant queens and colony sizes in the world. 2. Ecological genomics of an indicator species. This species is a very common species inhabiting forests and prairies on sandy soils throughout the lower 2/3 of the eastern US. This species extends to 40&#186; N where it can encounter harsh winters and hot summers. There are probably few insects that can be found from the wet subtropics (south Florida)&#44; dry subtropics (Texas) to maritime temperate (New Jersey/New York) and continental (Illinois/Missouri) environments. T. septentrionalis is an indicator species of natural communities found on sandy soils (1-3). Much less than 10% of the original coverage of sandy soil ecosystem remains intact today. Measures of its productivity (population size&#44; sexual production&#44; colony and fungal biomass&#44; etc.) correlate positively with factors that enhance and maintain the characteristics of these ecosystems (1). Populations of these ants can be so dense that they may excavate more than a metric ton of soil in a hectare of pine forest&#44; which typically have very nutrient poor soils (1). Populations of this species also respond to climate since they are higher in years of drought and lower in years of normal to above normal rainfall (3). Obtaining the genome of this species would have applications ranging from population and ecosystem ecology to conservation biology since it would provide a model system where we can understand the genetic mechanisms that underlie this species&#39; response to its environment. Specimens of this species are easy obtainable&#44; since populations are near major universities (University of Texas at Austin&#44; Florida State University&#44; University of Florida&#44; University of Illinois&#44; University of Missouri&#44; etc.). Genomic information will be curated and annotated in the labs of Ulrich Mueller (University of Texas at Austin)&#44; Steve Rehner (USDA&#44; Beltsville)&#44; and Ted Schultz (Smithsonian Institution).

This tephritid fruit fly has invaded the majority of countries where olives are grown&#44; including a recent invasion of the United States in the late 1990's. Despite the sequencing of its mitochondrial genome&#44; the country of origin of the OLF remains highly debated. Over 90% of olives are infested when OLF is present in a grove&#44; thus control is a concern for growers. OLF has been a target for sterile insect technique&#44; but difficulties remain in mass rearing the fly. Long-term reared laboratory strains have shorter lifespans and are not as competitive as wild flies. Instead&#44; insecticides remain the primary method for control though insecticide resistance is a growing problem. Finally&#44; the OLF associates primarily with one beneficial endosymbiont&#44; Candidatus Erwinia dacicola&#44; though other bacteria are transiently associated with the fly. C. E. dacicola is unusual in that it is one of the few non-pathogenic bacteria to transition between intracellular and extracellular lifestyles during fly development. The genome of this symbiont has been sequenced and is currently being examined. Sequencing the insect genome would allow for a more comprehensive understanding of how the insect and bacterium interact. Additionally&#44; tephritid fruit flies are global agricultural pests. Ceratitis capitata&#44; the Mediterranean fruit fly&#44; has already been sequenced and might be able to be used as a scaffold. Approximately 5 labs in the U.S.&#44; Italy&#44; Israel&#44; and Greece work on the olive fly symbiosis. More than 20 labs across the world conduct work on the pest management aspect of this fly. A strong network of hundreds of investigators work on closely related species of tephritid fruit flies. High quality&#44; freshly isolated genomic DNA can be easily obtained from a variety of laboratory strains and wild collected animals from a variety of populations.</td></tr>

Originate from Australia&#44; this gall-inducing wasp is now spreading quickly in Mediterranean countries&#44; Africa and Middle East&#44; causing damages to young plantations. The Eulophidae family includes many parasitoids but also a few gall-inducers. There are several major interests of getting genetic material for this species such as understanding the evolution of the gall inducers in the Eulophidae and also to dissect the complex gall-forming mechanisms. Moreover this species is a plant pest and increasing the knowledge on it's biology could lead to a better control.</td></tr>

Scorpions are agriculturally important for several reasons. First&#44; they produce venom peptides that specifically target insect nervous systems&#44; and recent research has demonstrated the utility of these peptides as insect biological control agents (Karbat et al.&#44; 2004; Song et al.&#44; 2011). Secondly&#44; as k-selected&#44; equilibrium species (Polis & Farley&#44; 1980) scorpions have the potential to control insect populations in agricultural regions. Aside from agriculture&#44; scorpions are medically significant. First&#44; they pose a severe public health hazard in Mexico (as well as many other regions of the world) where as many as 250&#44;000 envenomations resulting in up to 2&#44;500 deaths are reported each year. However&#44; scorpions also have therapeutic potential. Their venoms are currently being explored in a variety of treatments including brain gliomas (Kievet et al.&#44; 2010) and as analgesics (Wang et al.&#44; 2010). All of the medically important venoms come from scorpions in the family Buthidae. Buthids can generally be separated into two groups: the New World buthids and the Old World buthids. Old World buthids produce a family of mammal-specific toxins called beta-toxins&#44; where as New World buthids produce both alpha and beta mammalian toxins. The genus Centruroides is a New World buthid taxon distributed from northern South America to the southern United States&#44; throughout the Caribbean and the Galapagos. The genus is comprised of 71 species&#44; of which 10 are capable of lethal envenomation. A taxonomic revision of this group is currently underway (Esposito&#44; in prep). There are three species of Centruroides naturally distributed in the United States: Centruroides sculpturatus&#44; Centruroides vittatus and Centruroides hentzi. Preliminary results from molecular and morphological analyses indicate that these three species belong to three ecologically&#44; morphologically and genetically divergent clades: Centruroides sculpturatus belongs to a clade of scorpions&#44; endemic to North America&#44; that contains all of the Centruroides species capable of lethal envenomation. In fact&#44; Centruroides sculpturatus has itself been implicated in lethal envenomations of children in the United States. For this reasons&#44; along with the economic and therapeutic potential of buthid scorpion venom peptides&#44; and its natural occurrence in the United States&#44; Centruroides sculpturatus would make an ideal candidate for genome sequencing.

Their visual acuity is finer than any other terrestrial arthropod&#44; and there is electrophysiological evidence that they possess color vision. L. viridis is easy to keep in the lab&#44; is not aggressive&#44; and will readily behave naturally in the lab. I have run many successful behavioral experiments with L. viridis which should be published over the next few years. I expect (or at least hope) L. viridis will emerge as a model system among salticids in the years to come.

This group is characterized by highly innovative morphologies that are strikingly adapted to their various aquatic habitats. Appendages constitute one of the most diverse structures across this lineage in terms of shapes and sizes&#44; between segments of a single individual&#44; between the sexes&#44; and between species. Importantly&#44; we have a good understanding of the ecological forces that shape this diversity&#44; including interaction between the sexes&#44; adaptation to locomotion on the water surface&#44; and prey-predator interactions. Furthermore&#44; we have establishes RNA interference for single and multiple gene knockdown across several species in this group. This diversity offers a powerful model for identifying the genes and the genetic changes responsible for phenotypic change within species&#44; between populations&#44; and across species.

<tr><td>Atta texana</td><td>Ulrich Mueller</td><td>Nominated<br>(04/20/2011)</td><td>30</td><td>Agriculture&#44; Ecosystem Function&#44; Model Organism</td><td>The LEAFCUTTER ANT Atta texana is pest species impacting agriculture and forestry in the southern USA and northeastern Mexico&#44; particularly in pine plantations in Texas and Louisiana (also citrus&#44; pecan&#44; most ornamental plants). Losses are estimated at $5 million annually in the USA. A.texana is difficult to control due to the ant&#39;s enormous nest size (2-5 million workers per nest) (urbanentomology.tamu.edu/ants/leaf_cutting.cfm). Because A.texana is the northernmost leafcutter ant&#44; and because A.texana depends on cold-sensitive&#44; mutualistic fungi cultivated by the ants for food (Mueller et al. 2011a)&#44; A.texana is expected to spread northward and eastward throughout the Gulf states under the predicted climate warming (Mueller et al. 2011a). PEST MANAGEMENT: There are no insecticides currently available for specific control of leaf-cutter ants. Treating nests with general pesticides can contaminate water (nests are often near streams) (urbanentomology.tamu.edu/ants/leaf_cutting.cfm). Biocontrol methods currently under development focus on microbial pathogens of the ants and of the cultivated fungi. Pathogens impacting A.texana are different from those impacting leafcutter ants in the tropics (Rodrigues et al. 2008&#44; 2009). An integration of ongoing research on biocontrol methods with genomic information of the ant and the cultivated fungus is desirable. A draft genome of the cultivated fungus (Attamyces bromatificus; estimated 15x coverage) has already been generated (Mueller Lab&#44; Univ.Texas Austin)&#44; but the corresponding genome of A.texana is currently not being sequenced. INSECT-MICROBE MUTUALISM: Unlike the diffusely coevolving tropical leafcutter ants&#44; A.texana is the only leafcutter ant species with a specific ant-fungus association (Mueller et al. 2010&#44; 2011b). Moreover&#44; the microbiomes of A.texana ants and gardens have been characterized with both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods (16S-amplicon 454-sequencing) (Mueller et al. 2008; Rodrigues et al. 2008&#44; 2009; Ishak & Mueller unpublished). Genomic information of A.texana can therefore be interpreted in the context of specific ant-fungus coevolution and mutualistic/pathogenic microbial associates. OUTREACH: Several zoos currently exhibit A.texana as examples of insect-microbe mutualism and biological complexity (e.g.&#44; Houston Insect Zoo&#44; Carnegie Museum&#44; Montreal&#44; Smithsonian). Predicted genome size of A.texana: 300.3Mb &#46; 1.9 (average from 9 workers; Spencer Johnston and Mueller unpublished). To facilitate assembly&#44; A.texana males from a highly inbred population at the northernmost range limit have already been obtained; additional material can be collected from that population. The closest relatives of A.texana are Atta mexicana (Mexico to El Salvador) and Atta insularis (Cuba); these three species are in a distinct subgroup of Atta than the already sequenced tropical leafcutter ant Atta cephalotes (Suen et al. 2011). Number of researchers working on A.texana (including pest management research): >100. Genomic information of A.texana will be curated and annotated in the labs of Ulrich Mueller (Univ. Texas Austin)&#44; Steve Rehner (USDA&#44; Beltsville)&#44; and Ted Schultz (Smithsonian Institution).
